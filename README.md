# Professions
A Fabric mod that provides for long-term progression through repeatable actions that provide the player with experience, and if applicable, money rewards. The mod can be used Server AND Client or just on the Server. If used with a client you gain access to a menu with the 'R' key by default. This menu allows you to do most of the main actions in the mod.

Alternatively, you can use the builtin commands if you aren't fond of the menu. All the commands can be found [here](https://github.com/ExcessiveAmountsOfZombies/Professions/wiki/Commands)

Additional information for mod developers and modpack makers can be found [here](https://github.com/ExcessiveAmountsOfZombies/Professions/wiki/Extensions)

If you want to build the mod yourself, you will need to get the OctoEconomyAPI, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ExcessiveAmountsOfZombies/OctoEconomyApi/packages/1348942) Follow the instructions there and then you should have access to everything.

Forge can be built with `./gradlew :forge:build` <br/>
Fabric can be built with `./gradlew :fabric:build`
